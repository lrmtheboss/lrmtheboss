# Boss Minecraft Recommendations

These are my recommendations for minecraft related things.
All of these are based on my own experience and my own personal preferences, over the years of me playing minecraft, hosting minecraft servers, and working on minecraft servers.

If you think something is missing or want me to try something, please let me know!

## Launchers

Software used to launch the minecraft client.

- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) My old personal choice. Can handle multiple instances and accounts.
- [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/) My new personal choice. Has additional features over MultiMC.

## Server Software

Software used to run minecraft servers.

### Vanilla (Java Edition)

Software that dose not support Mods or Mod loaders such as Forge or Fabric.

#### Plugin

Spigot based server software and forks that supports plugins built on the bukkit api.
I'd recommend using Paper as the bare minimum. Paper provides a lot of optimizations over spigot. Purpur is also great, it is a fork of paper with extra features from them and other server software such as pufferfish. Refer to their websites for more information.

#### Proxy

Software used to connect multiple servers together to form a *network* of servers.
I'd recommend using Waterfall over Bungeecord as its Paper's fork of Bungeecord with more features and optimizations. Refer to their websites for more information.

*Note: May support modded servers behind them but I highly recommend not putting a modded server behind a proxy.*

[BungeeCord Website](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/)

### Forge (Java Edition)

Software that supports forge mods.

[Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) - standard forge server software (Recommended)
[SpongeForge](https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/spongeforge) - supports server side plugins as well, dose not work with certain mods.
